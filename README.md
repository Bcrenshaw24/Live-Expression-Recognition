# Live-Expression-Recognition

Created a Convolutional Neural Network from scratch and used live viideo to have it tell me my emotion

To use, simply run record.py
Deleted training and validation data for size optimality

You may see that, it isnt matching your expressions exactly
This is because it is trained on FER2013, a univerally recognized dataset that is known to be tough for ML models
The classes are massively skewed towards happy making it imbalanced
